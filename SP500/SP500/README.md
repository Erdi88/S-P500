# S&P 500 Stock Analysis Project

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing S&P 500 stocks. 
The dataset includes historical stock prices, volumes, and additional features that have been curated and cleaned to allow for efficient analysis and exploration.

## Project Structure
- `src/` – Contains scripts used to download, clean, and build the database.
- `notebook/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploring stock data, visualizing trends, and performing analysis.
- `data/` – The generated dataset with historical prices, volumes, and computed features.

## Dataset
The dataset is built from individual S&P 500 stock data collected from Wikipedia and other public sources. 
It has been cleaned, structured, and enhanced with additional features, making it easy to explore historical trends, calculate volatility, momentum, drawdowns, and other key metrics across multiple time horizons for individual stocks or groups of stocks.

## Analysis
This project allows you to:
- Explore historical stock prices and trading volumes.
- Visualize closing prices, volatility, and other derived metrics.
- Compare individual stocks across various performance measures.
- Identify best and worst momentum, drawdowns, and risk indicators.
- Use the dataset as a foundation for further analysis, including machine learning applications such as pattern recognition and predictive modeling.

The project is designed to be flexible, allowing users to perform detailed analyses of individual stocks or aggregate insights across the S&P 500, and to extend the dataset with new features or predictions.
